<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>My name is Terry Lippincott and I love to learn about computers and programming. When I create something and see it run for the first time, I get the same excitement today as I did when I first made &quot;Hello World&quot; appear on the screen as a teenager. I guess I'm just a big geek that also likes athletics, music, photography, good food and laughing.</p>

<p>I recently relocated to Chicago and I love the city and everything it has to offer. There are so many things here that inspire me and there are numerous avenues to learn almost anything.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Past</h3>

<p>35 years. That's how long I have been involved with data and computers. Even after all those years, I often times still feel like a novice. Many of the jobs I have had were focused in the Criminal Justice profession, but they somehow always ended up being heavily involved with computers and computer programming.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Present</h3>

<p>I am looking for my next adventure here in Chicago. While I'm waiting to find out exactly what that adventure may be, I'm teaching myself new programming languages and exploring new creative outlets.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Future</h3>

<p>I'm hoping to find a company looking for a seasoned veteran who still loves to learn new things. It's very exciting to see how fast things change and how quickly technology can change directions. It makes life truly fun.</p>
